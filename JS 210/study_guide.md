# 211 Study Guide
- ### assignments and comparison
- ### variable scope, especially how variables interact with function definitions and blocks
- ### function scope
- ### hoisting
- ### primitive values, types and type conversions/coercions
- ### object properties and mutation
- ### understand the differences between loose and strict equality
- ### how passing an argument into a function may or may not permanently change the value that a variable contains or points to
- ### working with Strings, Arrays, and Objects. 
  - In particular, you should be thoroughly familiar with the basic Array iteration methods
  (forEach, map, filter, and find) and how to use Object methods to access the keys and values in 
  an Object as an Array.
  - 
- ### understand that arrays are objects, and be able to determine whether you have an Array
  - use class method `Array.isArray` to determine if an object is an array 
  - the indices of an array are string representations of non-negative integer Numbers. 
  - Does bracket notation behave differently with arrays vs objects? 
    - [nope! They behave the same way] However, Ojects have "dot notation"
- ### variables as pointers
- ### console.log vs return
- ### truthiness: false and true vs. falsy and truthy
- ### function definition and function invocation
- ### function declarations, function expressions, and arrow functions
- ### implicit return value of function invocations
- ### first-class functions
- ### partial function application
- ### side effects
- ### naming conventions (legal vs idiomatic)
- ### pure functions and side effects
  - pure functions have no side effects and, given the same arguments, will always return the same values
  - consistency in return values means that there is no random 
  - side effects are:
    - mutation of objects outside of the scope of the function
    - reassignment of non-local variables 
    - reading from or writing to a file/external source
      - This is laundry list of many, including logged to the console 
    - raises an exception
    - it calls another function that has side effects
- ### strict mode vs. sloppy mode
- ### JavaScript syntactic sugar
