Assignment: Quiz Lesson 1

#7 - `ALTER TABLE` is a DDL command, that changes *schema*; I chose the four 
correct answers for this question, plus an incorrect answer about changing 
data in a specific row, which would need a command like, INSERT, DELETE, or UPDATE

#15 - Overlooked that a FULL OUTER JOIN would also accomplish the same as a LEFT JOIN
in this case because there were no rows in the right table that were not 
connected to rows in the left table. 1/2 correct answers. 

Quiz Lesspon 3:
#3 - admittedly, I didn't close read this question, and got 3/4 correct answers, 
and for the one that I missed, it was mistaking "maximum" for "minimum" in
"If one side of a relationship has a cardinality of one, the maximum number of 
entity instances that can be on that side of the relationship is one."

Maybe there's a meta lesson here about choosing to close read on the actual test,
to treat each answer choice as a clean slate, because in this case, the wording 
of the answer choice that missed was nearly identical to the wording of the 
previous answer choice, but with 'modality' and 'cardinality' traded out... as
well as 'max' and 'min', but I only caught the former pair. close read!

#8 I mixed up ascending and descending for alpha; asc means start at a and ascend
through to the end of the alphabet...
