	<h1>Hello, Internet!</h1>
	<article>
		<p>
			Welcome to my website! It's a work in progress as I <strong>HTML</strong>
			&amp <strong>CSS</strong> from a <em>mastery based</em> class I'm taking at
			<a href="https://launchschool.com/" open="_blank">Launch School</a>. I'm
			learning a lot, if you're interested.
		</p>
		<p class="more-text">
			There's not a lot of material on this page as I'm playing around with HTML &
			CSS. When I'm done, these last two paragraphs will take on a lighter color
			than the first - the "class" attribute on the two &lt;p&gt; tags and a bit of CSS
			will help accomplish that.
		</p>
		<p class="more-text" id="final-paragraph">
			This is the final paragraph. It also uses the `class` attribute as well as an
			`id` attribute. We'll use some CSS and the `id` attribute to underline the
			entire paragraph.
