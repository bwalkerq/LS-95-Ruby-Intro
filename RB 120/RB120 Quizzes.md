Lesson 1 quiz
- Only classes inherit from classes; objects do not inherit from their class,
  they are a template of their class.
- objects can not be instantiated from a module
- Modules share behaviors (methods), not attributes
- "include" is used for mix ins, not for inheritance
- I chose "Class inheritance lets us subclass from more than one class." 
  because String inherts from, for example, Object and Kernal and Basic 
  Object, but the important word here, I think, is "subclass"; this means 
  that a class can only be a direct subclass of exactly one superclass. The 
  chain of inheritance doesn't mean that the class is subclassing from 
  multiple classes.
- It's easy to overlook a attr_writer for attr_accessor; I did this in a 
  question. Maybe say it aloud to avoid mixup.
