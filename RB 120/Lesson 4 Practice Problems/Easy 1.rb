# 1. all of these are objects, and we can call #class on them to determine
# that their classes are TrueClass (not Boolean), String, Array, Integer,
# respectively

# 2 - remember to instantiate objects to call instance methods
# 3-the end, done. Easy to figure out in head, and moved on.

# All these problems are easy so far
# Because there are so many benefits to using OOP we will just summarize some of the major ones:
#
# Creating objects allows programmers to think more abstractly about the code they are writing.
# Objects are represented by nouns so are easier to conceptualize.
# It allows us to only expose functionality to the parts of code that need it, meaning namespace issues are much harder to come across.
# It allows us to easily give functionality to different parts of an application without duplication.
# We can build applications faster as we can reuse pre-written code.
# As the software becomes more complex this complexity can be more easily managed.

# Easy 3
# solid, these went fast
