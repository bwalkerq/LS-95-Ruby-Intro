# L2 Quiz 
50% ! Lowest score I've ever gotten? probably!

## #1
of 5 choices, 2/2 correct, and one incorrect answer chosen
Honestly, I didn't intentionally choose answer C because I don't even know what exec does.
I was taking it outside at medici, bright sunlight, so my guess is that it was a errant keystroke or something. 
whatever. no learning there. 

## #3
of 4, 3/3 correct answers, plus the one incorrect
using String.prot.split(' ') will returns empty strings any time two words are separated by 
more than one space. meh. This is the level of exactness that I need

## #6
of 6, correct answer chosen, plus one incorrect

Even though I wrote a test case for this, and the test case included the edge case of a string
ending with a '_', and showing that the last "token" included in the return would not have any 
letters... I still chose this answer. I am scattered today, this is a reminder to crush details 
in this assessment, with extreme focus on edge cases and clear understanding of input requirements.


reminders of questions for strings:
- What characters will separate tokens (or words)?
  - exactly one space, or more than one space? up to how many spaces?
