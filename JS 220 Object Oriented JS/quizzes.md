- 2/2 correct answers chosen
- one additional incorrect answer chosen, that "objects create a local scope"
  - this is incorrect because `{}` do not define a new scope in the case of an object literal
  in the same way that functions or `if` blocks do.
  - I am confused because I thought that variables defined in an object are scoped to that object...
    - it turns out that we can't define variables within an object unless they are function scoped,
    as a property function of the object.
