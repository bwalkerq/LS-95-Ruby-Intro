# notes from Philip 6/4
- if I get stuck with recursion in JS 225 or 230, go back and read the intro to recursion 
    lesson from LS 220
- Often context is missing from what's being taught (it's mostly a lot of problem solving
patterns, similar to what we discussed from practicing for the 216 live interview 
assessment)
