1. Display the initial empty 3x3 board.
  Probably keep the values of the board in a 9-element array, in "read-order" 123 top, 456 middle, 789 bottom. Could display them in 3x3 (2-D) format
2. Ask the user to mark a square.
  Could list the places as numbers until they're marked with X or O
3. Computer marks a square.
4. Display the updated board state.
5. If winner, display winner.
  For my array idea, this would be pretty hard to capture; there'd be a lot of winning combinations, how many?
    3 accross, 3 down, 2 diagonals (wow, WAY fewer than I thought, ha)
    
6. If board is full, display tie.
7. If neither winner nor board is full, go to #2
8. Play again?
9. If yes, go to #1
10. Good bye!
