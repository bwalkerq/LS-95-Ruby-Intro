AGENDA - WRITTEN ASSESSMENT

- introduction
- assessment format:
  - 3.5-hour time limit
  - 20-23 questions (ish) (9-10 min per question)
  - save your answers
  - using Markdown
- tips and tricks:
  - manage your time
  - brevity and clarity in all things, but don't leave out key details, precise terminology, or fundamental concepts
- questions?
  - use a precise definition at least once within your answer, and then after that you can refer to them more casually
  - The written assessments are open-book
- practice code snippets

# parameters and arguments
 - an argument is the object passed into the parameter at method invocation

# INTERVIEW ASSESSMENT prep with Rachele Lang

- Slack & Coderpad
- One hour. Two problems.
- Focus: Structured problem-solving approach, Ruby fluency, Communication ability.
- No documentation but personal notes okay.
- Don't be afraid to spend lots of time on PEDA before jumping into C.
- Make sure you understand the problem.
  - Feel free to ask questions.
  - Check test cases for implicit rules.
  - Write down what you find out to refer back to later.
- Develop your algorithm from a top-down approach.
  - break down to managageable chunks instead of solving the big problem all at once
- Test code frequently and verbally explain your expectations.
- Preparation: RB101-RB109 Small Problems, Pair up with other students.
  - Try to avoid writing the code-golf solutions because they can be difficult to communicate
- Questions?

# ask jonathan for a walkthrough with pry?

# feedback that I found useful:
- after finishing typing something in the algoritm phase, pause to say why you wrote what you just did
- come up with more than one approach, just to acknowledge it, mention it, and then say that I'm going to take this approach bc [reason], and then you have opened an escape window for you later if you crash and burn
- record myself while I'm coding, listen back to know how I sound [yeesh] [I think I'll pass on this idea, at least for now; I assume I have better than average communication from my years teaching, and will practice it if made necessary to me]
